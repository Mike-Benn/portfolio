## Portfolio Site

My first attempt at making a portfolio site.  I'm not happy with some of it and would like to revisit it very soon after I do a little more research and studying of responsive web design.  
I know one of the upcoming chapters in TOP revolves around this subject so I expect to revisit it at that point.  I'm tempted to skip ahead to it after I finish the intermediate HTML and CSS 
section.
